# What information can my company see when I enroll my device in Intune?

When you enroll a device into management, you are giving your company's IT department permission to access certain pieces of information on your device to help protect the corporate data on the device.

**What IT cannot see**

- Calling and web browsing history
-	Location
- Personal email
- Text messages
- Contacts
-	Passwords to your personal accounts
- Calendar events
- Pictures, including what's in the photos app or camera roll

**What IT can see**

-   Model
-   Serial number
-   Operating system version
-   App names
-   Owner
-   Device name
-   Manufacturer (for devices not made by Apple)
-   Phone number (for work devices, the whole number. For personal devices, just the last four digits.)
